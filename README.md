## Remarkable Templates

I made these templates based on different sources.

- `today` template is based on: https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog
- `cornell` template is based on: https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/

Steps to add them to the reMarkable: https://remarkablewiki.com/tips/templates
